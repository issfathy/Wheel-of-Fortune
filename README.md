This project was completed with the help of Bibin Benny, Shreya Sanjiv, and Fathy Elhadidy from La Salle Univeristy. 

## Issues Encountered:
- We have tried to implement a wheel but could not find a successful way to do so but we did come close. 
- We also encountered a difficulty with creating a timer that did not care about a user input but instead kept counting until the time ran out
